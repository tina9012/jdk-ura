# EISOP Development Notes

## Updating from a different fork

To update EISOP with changes in a different Checker Framework fork, follow these steps:

1. Pull in eisop/master and make sure you don't have any uncommitted files.

1. Create a new branch, named e.g. `typetools-3.18.0-fixes`, and push to eisop, without any changes.

1. Create a new branch, named e.g. `typetools-3.18.0-merge`.

1. If necessary, change to consistent formatting:
    - Remove `.aosp()` from `build.gradle`.
    - Run `./gradlew spotlessApply` and commit results as e.g. `Change to typetools formatting`.

1. Look up the commit IDs for the range you want to include, e.g. previous and current releases.

1. Fetch the new release into a different branch `git fetch typetools toID:typetools-3.18.0-release`.

1. Do `git cherry-pick fromID..toID`.

1. If there are conflicts, resolve and do `git cherry-pick --continue`.

1. If necessary, undo formatting changes and commit `Change back to AOSP formatting`.

1. Open a pull request (against eisop) merging `typetools-3.18.0-merge` into `typetools-3.18.0-fixes`.
  Once this looks OK, squash and merge titled `typetools/checker-framework x.y.z release`, making
  sure to keep all authors.

1. Go through all changes in more detail and clean up any problems.
  This two-step process gives us one commit with the external changes and separate commits with
  eisop-specific changes and enhancements.

1. Open a pull request (against eisop) merging `typetools-3.18.0-fixes` into `master` and
  merge without squashing.

## Release process

TODO: the release process contains many buffalo-specific paths, which still needs to be cleaned up.
Most of the instructions can be followed, ignoring certain steps.

Without using the release scripts, you can make a Maven Central release using:

````bash
./gradlew publish -Prelease=true --no-parallel -Psigning.gnupg.keyName=wdietl@gmail.com
````

You may need to run `gpg-agent` first and enter the GPG password when prompted.

Use `--warning-mode all` to see gradle deprecation warnings.
